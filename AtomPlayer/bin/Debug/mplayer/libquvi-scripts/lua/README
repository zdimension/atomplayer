Debugging tips
==============

Search paths
------------

Typical libquvi lua script search paths. Scanned in the following order:

  1) $LIBQUVI_SCRIPTSDIR

  2) Current working directory

  3) $HOME/.libquvi-scripts/

  4) $HOME/.config/libquvi-scripts/

  5) $HOME/.local/share/libquvi-scripts/

  6) `pkg-config --variable scriptsdir libquvi-scripts`
     typically this is "$prefix/share/libquvi-scripts/"

The library will look for the scripts under lua/ subdirectory.


Environment variables
---------------------

  LIBQUVI_SHOW_SCANDIR  - If set, libquvi prints out the scanned dir paths
  LIBQUVI_SHOW_SCRIPT   - If set, libquvi prints out the found scripts
  LIBQUVI_SCRIPTSDIR    - If defined, libquvi scans it for the scripts first
